# Assignment:
Developing a few classes with C++ to model a `CALCULATOR APP`

## Coding Guidlines:
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#C++11>


## Use Case :
 
Design a Calculator App which has normal calculator functionality.


## Requirement:

A simple front end harness as either a basic html-based application (say javascript or php, etc) or a
script that uses CURL (or similar) to make and accept requests from your server.
The server should support GET, POST, PUT and DEL as you see fit. The server should be reliable
and fault tolerant.


## Assumption:

```complete me``` 
 


## Solution:
 
```complete me```

## Known Issues :
This is first initial version `as per requirement document` so the new` feature` would be added in future.
In future HMI/Graphical user interfce is developed in the `Qt` for  supporting crosss platfrom compatibility.
