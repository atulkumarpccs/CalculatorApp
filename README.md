# Assignment:
Developing a few classes with C++ to model a `CALCULATOR APP`

## Coding Guidlines:
<https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#C++11>


## Use Case :
 
Design a Calculator App which has normal calculator functionality.


## Requirement:

```complete me```


## Assumption:

```complete me``` 
 


## Solution:
 
```complete me```

## Known Issues :
This is first initial version `as per requirement document` so the new` feature` would be added in future.
On some places constructer has been invoked and some places uniform initialization has been invoked.
In place of `pragma once` ``header gaurd`` are used for older compiler support.

In future HMI/Graphical user interfce is developed in the `Qt` for  supporting crosss platfrom compatibility.
